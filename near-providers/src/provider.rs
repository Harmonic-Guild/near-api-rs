//! This module defines the `Provider` trait for interacting with the NEAR blockchain.
//! It provides a high-level API for various blockchain operations, such as querying the chain status,
//! sending transactions, and fetching information about blocks, chunks, and validators.
//! The `Provider` trait is designed to be implemented by specific providers, with a JSON RPC provider currently implemented,
//! allowing users to easily connect to and interact with the NEAR chain.
